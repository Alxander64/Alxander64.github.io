> What was originally downloadable content for Uncharted 4, now a standalone product, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy introduces some new mechanics and brings a compelling enough story for the 10 year old franchise.

# A New Take

For the first time in Uncharted history, the game doesnt have you playing as the witty, adventurous Nathan Drake. Instead you play as his old partner who was noticeably absent throughout Uncharted 4, Chloe Frazer. Having you play as a different character for the first time gives the game a nice and refreshing mixup while still maintaining the Uncharted feeling everyone has come to love so much. Set several months after the events of Uncharted 4, Chloe recruits Nadine Ross to retrieve the Tusk of Ganesh. When announced prior to the games launch that you would be teaming up with Nadine, I was skeptical. In the previous title, Uncharted 4, she was my least favourite character. She had no purpose in the game other than to give Nathan Drake a group of militia soldiers to fight, but I was willing to give Nadine another chance and low and behold, she was awesome. This time, she has an actual purpose to the plot and like all other Naughty Dog games, the back and forth dynamic between the characters really is the best part of the game.

# Familiar Mechanics

All of the new mechanics introduced in Uncharted 4 are back in this game. The Grappling Hook, Piton, sliding and driving all make a return and felt great. I never felt the game overused any of these mechanics as they were spread out enough throughout to make them each feel fun and refreshing every time. Combat is the same cover-shoot system you come to expect from Uncharted. However, the inclusion of several new weapons injected some freshness into the combat whenever I was put into a skirmish. The largest addition to the game was the introduction of a semi open world section that only takes place in one chapter. The game gives you the option to explore this world where you can hunt for certain types of collectibles or just continue on the main story. If only playing through the story, the chapter could take 20 - 30 minutes, however, for those that choose to explore everything this chapter has to offer, they could be here at least 3 hours. I thoroughly enjoyed this section of the game and would like to see this addition in future titles.

The antagonist in the game, Asav, seemed out of place. You see him for the first time half way through the game and throughout he has questionable and unexplained motives. Why does Asav, want to blow up an Indian city? Why does Asav want to spark a civil war? How did Asav, who was normally a doctor, hire thousands of people to fight for him? All these are unanswered, making Asav seem similar to Nadine in Uncharted and that his only purpose was to give Chloe and Nadine a group of random enemies to fight. I feel they could have fleshed out the character more and created a more appealing villain instead of a character who is bad for the sake of being bad.

# Verdict

In the end, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is a solid package that left me wanting more. The 7-9 hour campaign packs in tons of content, some familiar and some new with a serviceable storyline. The character interactions and combat that you've come to expect from Naughty Dog really bring the game together.  If you're able to look past the bland villain, there is no reason you shouldn't pick this up, especially if you're a fan of Uncharted.
